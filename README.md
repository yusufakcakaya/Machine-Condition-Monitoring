# Machine Condition Monitoring ðŸŽ°

***

### Mission

The company has collected audio samples of equipment working on normal and anomalous conditions. Their objective is to develop a machine learning model able to monitor the operations and identify anomalies in the sound pattern. The sounds are related with some machines like fan, pump, valve and slider.In this project, it is aimed to find an optimal solution using supervised machine learning and deep learning Models.

### Mission objectives

Week 1
- Be able to work and process data from audio format
- Find insights from data
- Get data and save features to csv
- Build machine learning models for predictive classification and/or regression
- Select the right performance metrics for model
- Evaluate the distribution of data points and evaluate its influence in the model
- Be able to identify underfitting or overfitting that might exist on the model

Week 2
- Tuning parameters of the model for better performance
